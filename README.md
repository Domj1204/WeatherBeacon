# Features
Real-time weather updates.
Search history storage and interaction.
Responsive design for various devices.

# Local Storage Explanation
Local storage is used to save the user's search history persistently. The application stores each searched city in an array, which is then saved to the browser's local storage. This allows the application to remember the user's previous searches even after the browser is closed and reopened.
